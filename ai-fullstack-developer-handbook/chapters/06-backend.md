# Chapter 6: Backend Development with AI

## 🛠 What is Backend Development?

The backend is the **engine** of your application. It processes requests, handles logic, manages databases, and connects external systems.

As a fullstack developer, backend skills include:

- API design (REST, GraphQL)
- Server-side logic
- Authentication and security
- Database integration
- Data validation and business rules

---

## 🤖 How AI Enhances Backend Development

AI tools can:

- Generate FastAPI/Express/Django routes
- Write database models and migrations
- Set up JWT-based authentication
- Refactor async logic
- Suggest scalable architecture

---

## 🧠 Prompt Formula for Backend Tasks

```
Write [framework] code to create an endpoint for [action], 
with [authentication/validation/database] using [tool/database].
```

### ✅ Example Prompt

> Write a FastAPI route to transfer funds between two user accounts. Use Pydantic for validation and Supabase (PostgreSQL) for storage. Require JWT auth.

## 🚀 Recommended Tech Stack

| Layer       | Tool         |
|-------------|--------------|
| API Server  | FastAPI      |
| DB Layer    | Supabase     |
| ORM         | SQLModel / Prisma |
| Auth        | JWT / OAuth2 |
| Hosting     | Fly.io / Railway / Render |

## 📦 Backend Folder Structure (FastAPI Example)

```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── auth.py
│   │   ├── accounts.py
│   │   ├── transactions.py
│   │   └── loans.py
│   ├── models/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── core/      # config, db
│   └── utils/
├── tests/
├── requirements.txt
└── alembic/       # DB migrations
```

## 🔒 Auth & Security (AI Prompt Examples)

**Prompt**:

> Create a FastAPI middleware that checks for a valid JWT in the Authorization header.

AI should return:

- `Depends()` usage
- JWT decode/verify function
- `HTTPException` for invalid tokens

**Security Tips:**

- Validate all inputs with Pydantic
- Use HTTPS and secure headers
- Store secrets via `.env` or Supabase Vault
- Implement RBAC and rate limiting

---

## 🧪 Testing Backend with AI

Prompt:

> Generate a `pytest` test for the `/api/transfer` endpoint that mocks the DB and JWT.

Use cases AI can cover:

- Unit tests for services
- Auth flow testing
- DB mocks with `pytest-mock` or `unittest.mock`

---

## ⚙️ Common Backend Prompts

- "Generate a FastAPI route to register a new user with hashed password and email verification"
- "Write SQLAlchemy model for loan repayments"
- "Create a secure logout endpoint that blacklists JWTs"
- "Design a webhook handler for Stripe payments in Django"

---

## 📡 Database Integration Tips

Use AI to scaffold:

- Supabase tables (via SQL or UI)
- Pydantic or SQLModel classes
- Supabase client config

Example Prompt:

> Generate a FastAPI CRUD route for the `transactions` table using SQLModel and Supabase.
